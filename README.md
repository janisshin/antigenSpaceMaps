This code was created for Dr. Rui Kong to help screen virtual models of virus-like-particles by structural similarity, specifically in antigen presentation. 
AngleFinder.sh will create files that will be needed to run occlusion_map.py
The output of occlusion_map should be bit maps showing at what angle in 3D space that a Fab can approach an antigen. 
The dimensions of the Fab can be changed in occlusion_map. 

If you want to use this code, you need to find all instances of <folder> and change it to the filepath you want.
